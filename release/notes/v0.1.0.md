First public release! :tada:

The core design and functionality I set out to implement is done at this point, but there are still plenty of bugs to fix and minor features I wish to add soon. Adding some documentation is high priority as well.

In the meantime, if you're curious, feel free to test this version out, and please [report any issues](https://github.com/hackfixme/miu/issues)! :bow:
